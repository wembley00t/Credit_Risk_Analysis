# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

Using the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the following will be completed to predit credit risk:

  * Oversample the data using Random Over Sampler and SMOTE algorithims
  * Undersample the data using the Cluster Centroids algorithm
  * Combinational approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
  * Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier

## Results

The below will desribe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of the six machine learning models.

### Naive Random Oversampling
### SMOTE Oversampling
### Undersampling with Cluster Centroids Algorithm
### Combination Over and Under Sampling with SMOTEENN
### Balanced Random Forest Classifer
### Easy Ensemble Classifier
